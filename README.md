## FlutterLearningJourney

The `FlutterLearningJourney` directory contains code organized by different chapters or topics. Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect of Flutter development.

## Mini Projects

Explore the `mini-projects` directory to find small applications and projects that I've implemented to practice and reinforce my understanding of Flutter. Each mini project is stored in a separate branch for better organization.

note:
In this version, the `Mini Projects` section emphasizes that each mini project is stored in a separate branch for better organization. Users can switch to the specific branch of interest to explore and work on individual mini projects.

To explore a specific mini project:

1. Select the branch corresponding to the project you're interested in.
   ```bash
   git checkout mini-project-branchName
